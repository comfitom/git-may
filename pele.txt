hahaha Pele was a great footballer and the best ever just like maradonna, they are the best ever to grace the pitch


Wish we could have people like them again to play football for us to enjoy and the likes of garinch and others

If there were any great that comes close, it would be eusebio

At 18, Pele was untouchable and had an immense fitness seen by none till date
